🛡️ Trade Management Logic: manage_trade()
`manage_trade(symbol)` is responsible for active position supervision, specifically handling stop-loss adjustment logic.

🔄 Workflow
Fetch Tick for Symbol

```python
tick = mt5.symbol_info_tick(symbol)
```

Call Indicator for SL Management

```python
atr_result = dispatch_position_manager_indicator(symbol, "ATR")
``` 

Load Current Positions

Pulls from `positions.json` and `total_positions.json`

Apply SL Logic per Position

For each open position on symbol, it calls:
```python
  recommended_sl = sl_trailing_staircase(symbol, pos, tick, atr)
```
If the `recommended_sl` is more protective (closer to break-even or profit), AlgoOne updates the SL.


📉 Logic: sl_trailing_staircase()
This method implements the trailing stop-loss strategy.

It only triggers if:
```python
position.profit_pct >= trailing_profit_threshold
```

Where the default threshold is:
```python
"trailing_profit_threshold_decimal": 0.005  # 0.5% profit
```

If above threshold:
It computes a dynamic stop-loss:

```python
trail_sl = price_now - atr * multiplier
trail_sl = max(trail_sl, open_price + atr * break_even_offset)
```

ATR Multiplier: Distance from current price

Break-Even Offset: Enforces a SL at least X% in profit from entry

Default configuration:
```python
"break_even_offset_decimal": 0.123  # 12.3% of ATR
```

This balances risk protection with breathing room for volatile instruments.


🧠 Summary
SLs are only adjusted when in profit

The adjustment is based on volatility (ATR) and symbol-specific configuration

Stops are never moved backward

Modular logic allows multiple SL strategies (e.g., `simple_manage_sl`, `manage_volatility_sl`, etc.)
